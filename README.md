# Keyboard-In-The-Middle

The project is a proof of concept of utilizing the vulnerability of a [man-in-the-middle attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack), by impersonating a BLE keyboard and control all traffic in between using Texas Instruments [CC-2650 LP](http://www.ti.com/tool/launchxl-cc2650) evaluation boards.
